# GamerServerClientCombo
A basic template to create a multiplayer game app using SFML

The previous "feature" that caused the application to never quit is being tenatively withdrawn. TCP messages between server and client have been tested and have worked on the same laptop.

Planned Updates:
1. testing on local and global connections
2. udp messaging

That's pretty much it. The entire point of this project is to be as simple (and therefore flexible/useful) as possible.
